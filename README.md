# shop-redux

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API

To install this application clone the file from GitHub by running "git clone" from your terminal and then run "npm install".Once the file is loaded run "npm start" from the the network terminal in the root folder.
